          MedHacks, the world’s premier medical hackathon, is proud to announce its fourth annual hackathon, MedHacks 2018: Snow Day! Join us from September 7-9 at the Johns Hopkins Hospital for 36 hours of innovation at crossroads of medical entrepreneurship and technological development.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3> Our History </h3>
      <p>
            MedHacks was born in 2014 as a result of seeing the extreme disparity between the areas in medicine that need innovation and the growing interest in entrepreneurship in our generation. The idea behind MedHacks is that you don’t need an MD or PHD to hack health, nor do you need a background in computer science. All you need is an interest in making the world a better place.
        </p>

    <h2>Tracks</h2>
    <p>At MedHacks 2018: Frostbitten, you’ll have the choice between three sponsored tracks. The hack you decide to do must fall within the track that you choose and you will be judged within your track for a track-specific prize. Tracks from previous years have been Medication Adherence with CVS Health and Access to Care with Blue Cross Blue Shield.</p>
    <p>Stay tuned for an announcement of tracks for MedHacks 2018!</p>
